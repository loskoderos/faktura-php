# Faktura PHP

Generate pretty PDF invoices in PHP

## What is this?

Faktura in polish means invoice and this library is created to render pretty invoices in PHP.

Faktura is a simple standalone PHP library for rendering PDF invoices in PHP.
You can easily integrate it into your own project using standard tools like
composer. Currently, Faktura depends on _xvfb_ and _wkhtmltopdf_ to create PDF
files. Faktura has builtin rendering based on native PHP templates that can be
customized with plugin functions.
